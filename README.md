## Hello World!

Code to be isolated is wrapped inside the run() method of a HystrixCommand similar to the following:

```php
public class CommandHelloWorld extends HystrixCommand<String> {

    private final String name;

    public CommandHelloWorld(String name) {
        super(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey("ExampleGroup"));
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    protected String run() {
        return "Hello " + name + "!";
    }
}
```
